# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, built in Java. The repository contains all code and additional files in order to run the game properly. You can also find a video attached.

# Layout
The game consists of a window that is mouse sensitive, and can take input from the player by pressing the mouse. You can choose between playing against an algorithm I've designed or playing against another player at the same computer. You can also choose if you want to play with 'X' or 'O'. After these two choices have been made, the player/players can start the game. The "RESET" button restarts the game, opening a fresh window for a new round.

# Have fun!
